# Bachelor's Thesis 2021: Automatic Generation of Russian Puns

This repository contains several experiments for generating Russian puns. Since there was no dataset available for fine-tuning, language models were used in the following way:

1. [BERT](https://github.com/AnnMokhova/ba_thesis/blob/main/text%20generation%20with%20neural%20networks/BERT_Generation.ipynb) for text generationg;

2. [BERT](https://github.com/AnnMokhova/ba_thesis/blob/main/text%20generation%20with%20neural%20networks/BERT_Masked_Language_Model.ipynb) used with a pre-defined pun template that predicts the masked work in the template;

3. [GPT-2 and RuGPT-3](https://github.com/AnnMokhova/ba_thesis/blob/main/text%20generation%20with%20neural%20networks/Generate_text_with_RuGPT.ipynb) for text generation.
